# Craft Migrations
Migration Files for a fresh install of Craft 3 to quickly create a new project

Simply upload the migrations folder to your Craft 3 project and run them to create a default set of fields, volumes, and plugins in your project.

Please also feel free to use these as a starting point to write your own custom migration files.
